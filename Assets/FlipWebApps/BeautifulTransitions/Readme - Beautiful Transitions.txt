QUICK START

	1. If you have an older version installed:
		1.1. Make a backup of your project
		1.2. Delete the old /FlipWebApps/BeautifulTransitions folder to cater for possible conflicts.
	2. Check out the demo scenes under /FlipWebApps/BeautifulTransitions/_Demo

NOTE: Unity 5.0 - 5.1 does not support the dropdown used in the ScreenCamera demo scene. The transitions work, but you will have to preview them manually.
