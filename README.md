  __What is it?__
  ---

  The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a powerful yet lightweight generation 1 battle simulator. The goal origionally was to have a mobile version available to attack basic AI with all of the attack moves and any pokemon in the game. I am looking to release this on iPhone and Android. 
  
  __What is left?__
  ---
  
  Above states that the ideal pokemon game will use sprites but due to the recent popularity of pokemon go, and VR, I would like to implement all of the pokemon models in VR, I have noticed they aren't rigged so while this poses a <b>major</b> issue, we will see how I move forward. What is left is 2 attack moves, whirlwind and roar, final calulcations (double checking) and a basic mobile version, with basic AI and functionality. After this is completed for both android and iPhone. There was a download previously, there isn't now because I just finished a second rework of the API (4/1/2017), and want to incorporate the final UI features and swaping before releasing. Future goals include either (team building and networking) or (implementing the 2D game). I consider this inital part the hard part, however with the latest rework I am finally setlled on the state of the project.
