  The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a powerful yet lightweight generation 1 battle simulator. The goal origionally was to have a mobile version available to attack basic AI with all of the attack moves and any pokemon in the game. It's current goal is a cross platform multiplayer generation 1 battle system open for expansion into other generations. I will be releasing in order, web, desktop platforms, mobile, VR/AR!
