  __What is it?__
  ---

  The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a powerful yet lightweight generation 1 battle simulator. I actually was able to compelte that goal, with basic AI and had an inital release and posted the game as webGL, buttttt that isn't good enough for me, so it's round 3 and I am a lot better of an engineer so it's go time, I am going to redo this game hard. We're talking networking, we're talking analytics, we're talking cross platform play. Yeah, we're going to leverage the cloud, we're going to leverage the best technologies out there. Let's do this.
