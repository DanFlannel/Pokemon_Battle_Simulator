  *What is it?*
  -----------

  The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a powerful yet lightweight generation
  1 battle simulator. Originally designed as an intended mobile version of
  Pokemon Showdown, and as a friend's challenege. As a personal project, I 
  intend to keep the code robust and expandable for anyone to possibly add
  further generations of Pokemon and their attacks.
