  __What is it?__
  ---

  The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a powerful yet lightweight generation 1 battle simulator. The goal origionally was to have a mobile version available to attack basic AI with all of the attack moves and any pokemon in the game. Now the goal is adjusted to be simply Pokemon Statium in VR.
  
  __What is left?__
  ---
  
  Above states that the ideal pokemon game will use sprites but due to the recent popularity of pokemon go, and VR, I have to implement all of the pokemon models in VR, I have noticed they aren't rigged so while this poses an issue, we will see how I move forward. What is left is 2 attack moves, final calulcations and a basic mobile version, with basic AI and functionality. After this is completed for both android and iPhone I will move on to the VR portion, which should be simple if I already have the mobile version completed. Also I would like to have the pokedex/database (generation 1 only) finished updating along with all 600+ attacks (all generations). There is no current download as I redid a lot of it and lost some functionality in the process.
