# Pokemon_Battle_Simulator
    The purpose of this project is to create a working standlone client that is a full and complete pokemon battle simulator for the generation 1 pokemon. The platform being used is Unity 3D. The reasoning behind this project is that Pokemon is an extremely complex game in terms of how many different things will happen so I figured that this would be a good coding challenge for myself. I also plan on makeing this work for the mobile version if possible, if the mobile build in Unity will allow the full usage of .Net 2.0 not .Net 2.0 subset.
